US-EIN-521257057-US-EIN-521257057,1,1,"The world faces multiple crises. Our system of life is at an inflection point. Growing inequality and economic turmoil are profoundly affecting society. The impacts of climate change — from record heat waves to destructive floods — are becoming ever-more apparent. Biodiversity is declining, with some species on the verge of collapse. 

Policymakers, business leaders and concerned citizens know that the world cannot continue on its current path — and indeed, many are already embarking on a transition to a better future. A growing share of electricity now comes from wind, solar and other renewables. Electric vehicle uptake is on the rise. More investors are directing finance toward sustainability.",,1

US-EIN-521257057-US-EIN-521257057,3,3,"WRI’s work under the People goal has three dimensions:
1. Ensure inclusive processes that give marginalized and disadvantaged communities opportunities to 
inform decision-making.
2. Commit to invest in and implement initiatives that marginalized and disadvantaged communities have 
prioritized to improve their lives.
3. Dismantle structural barriers that keep marginalized and disadvantaged communities trapped in poverty 
and/or bearing disproportionate burdens of the climate and nature crises. 
Addressing the interconnected People, Nature and Climate goals will require reconfiguring power 
relationships and structures in Human-Centered and Enabling Systems. To this end, WRI’s work under the 
People goal will focus on achieving two types of equity: procedural and distributive

Procedural equity is concerned with the fairness of how decisions are made and by whom. Distributive 
equity is concerned with the distribution of benefits and burdens of a policy action, initiative or intervention 
among different groups. Both dimensions of equity focus on whose interests count and at what spatial, 
temporal and social scales. Both prioritize allocation of resources to communities that have historically 
experienced disproportionate discrimination or disparities in access to opportunities and/or have suffered 
disproportionately from inequities overall, whether social, economic, environmental or political.

WRI will advance the People goal by ensuring procedural equity in our own work so that marginalized 
groups have opportunities to shape project planning and inform decision-making and implementation in all 
our activities",,1
