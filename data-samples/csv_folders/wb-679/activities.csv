44000-P126193,Second Phase of the APL on Strengthening Regional Cooperation for Wildlife Protection in Asia,"The objective of the Second Phase of the Adaptable Program Lending (APL) on Strengthening Regional Cooperation for Wildlife Protection in Asia Project is to assist the participating governments of Bhutan and others to build or enhance shared capacity, institutions, knowledge and incentives to collaborate in tackling illegal wildlife trade and other selected regional conservation threats to habitats in border areas. There are three components to the project, the first component being capacity building for addressing the illegal trans-boundary wildlife trade. This component aims to bring about regional harmonization and collaboration in combating wildlife crime through strengthened legislative and regulatory frameworks, well-equipped specialized agencies and systems, as well as relevant training and awareness programs for staff across the range of agencies that contribute to the enforcement of wildlife laws and regulations. The second component is the promoting wildlife conservation in Asia. Finally, the third component is the project coordination and communication. This component will focus on project coordination and communications. Since project coordination and implementation will be carried out by Wildlife Conservation Division (WCD's) regular staff, with support from Department of Forest and Park Services (DOFPS) and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forests (MOAF), funding of project coordination and operating costs will be Royal Government of Bhutan (RGOB) contribution to the project. No project funds will be used for this purpose. However, financial support to Bhutan for regional coordination is required due to the need to closely coordinate regional activities among participating countries.",3,,USD,0,1,2025-04-13T23:57:24,en,44000,World Bank,40,2011-05-31,2011-06-17,2016-08-31,2016-08-31,,,679,"South Asia, regional",,,,,
